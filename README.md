This is a kaleidoscope-inspired drawing tool. It was built in Vanilla JavaScript with a touch of jQuery for event handling. LocalStorage is used for saving user settings. Some external libraries and tools were included for file saving and color picking.

## Where it's at
Any time of year you can find it [here](http://mandala-app.com/). I recommend you try it on both mobile and desktop to see what works best for you, usability-wise.

## Tutorial
To truly understand how it works, why don't you try and build it yourself? This is my Mandala Maker [tutorial](https://24ways.org/2018/the-art-of-mathematics).
