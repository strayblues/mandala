This is a kaleidoscope-inspired drawing tool. It was built in Vanilla JavaScript with a touch of jQuery for event handling. LocalStorage is used for saving user settings. External libraries and tools included for the purpose of file saving and color picking.

## Where it's at
Any time of year you can find it [here](http://mandala.hagarsh.com/). I recommend you try it on both mobile and desktop to see what works best for you, usability-wise.
